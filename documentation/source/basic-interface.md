In the asset graph, the orange line is the realized asset, and the gray line is the asset that even reflects unrealized profit. The gray line is the asset you are holding at the current price of the position you are holding. In the picture below, you can see the orange line sticking to the gray line as soon as you close the position.

Only the returns of the actually executed trades are reflected in the "Total realized profit". Other asset changes such as deposits and withdrawals are not reflected in this value. Trading fees on Binance are reflected.

> Even if it is not an automatic order, if you buy and sell directly, the profit from the purchase is also reflected in this value.

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Choose a Strategy and Leverage

It is recommended to check the return and risk of the strategy and leverage you want to choose through simulation before the actual automatic ordering.

To get meaningful results, you need to perform simulation calculations with enough candle data. In the "Collect" tab, you can fill the historical candle data.

After the simulation calculation, you can find the points with the lowest unrealized returns. Experiment with varying simulation leverage. You can see when you were closest to a forced liquidation and how dangerous it was. As soon as it approaches -100%, A forced liquidation is made from Binance.

## ðŸ§¾ Extra Tips

- Solie was developed for Binance-focused automatic ordering and simulation purposes. Other exchanges are not supported.
- Even if candle data has not been accumulated by turning off Solie for a while, the holes within the last 24 hours are gradually filled automatically.
- All times are in represented in UTC, Coordinated Universal Time.
- Candle data is recorded every 10 seconds. That means there are 6 candlesticks every minute.
- If auto transaction is on, positions will be set to cross-margin mode and futures accounts will be set to one-way mode, single asset mode. This is because the calculation methods and risk management used for automatic ordering and simulation are tailored to this.
- The option "Draw frequently" updates the transaction graph every 10 seconds if enabled. For performance reasons, only the last 24 hours of data are drawn in the transaction graph with this option turned on. The complete data can be viewed in the simulation graph with the option "Draw all years". If "Draw frequently" is disabled, the graph gets updated every hour with the advantage of displaying an entire year.
- A red light icon in the strategy selection menu means that the strategy cannot be used.
- Binance limits the number of requests per specific hour for each IP address. Be careful that your IP address does not overlap with other people who use Solie, such as a VPN or public network. If the number of computers running Solie is small, it is okay to use the same IP at the same time.
